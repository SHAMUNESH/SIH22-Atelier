# Inspiration
Our overall design of the eCommerce for artisans is created with the artisans at the center of the object in mind. The entire web framework, module implementation, user experience, and UI were designed in a way that is both suitable for them and engaging for regular online shopping customers.

# What it does
The E-commerce website (Atelier) is designed to provide a platform for artisans to sell their products by registering their company/organization with the website. The sellers will be provided a profile to upload their products, its features and prices. Customers will have an option to customize their products and save their creation by using our unique ‘atelier code’, which they can use to revisit their customization. A virtual assistant(Iris) will be guiding the customers throughout their purchase journey with AI-powered recommendation system up until the transaction.

# How we built it
Our idea of E-Commerce stands unique among the existing platforms on our core ideology of providing the solution to the most obvious question, How will be our artisans will get used to the web technology we provide? Keeping in mind, that having their entire business away from online and having one-to-one communication with their customer has been in their culture.  So, we have come up with an AI Voice Assistance which will take care of the seller's overall personal, technology, sales, and production and also customer support!  The AI Model we planned to build is so effective that it handles all possible challenges our artisans may face while using our E-Commerce.

The Tech Stack we are using, 
- Frontend - HTML5,CSS,Javascript, ReactJS.
- Backend - PHP, Nodejs, RestAPIs.
- AI Model - Python, NLP, Voice modules.

# Challenges we ran into
We have managed to visualize our whole work with a futuristic scope, so one challenge we came across the system design for our AI Assistance model and the Quality Assurance check meter, since those complex algorithm based modules must go well blended with the web framework, there are few challenges in making the whole process go easy! But, we have figured out the way to crack the challenge and are in progress to capture the milestones.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
```
- Atelier code
- Iris(AI based Virtual Assistant)
- Quality Assurance Check Meter
```

# What we learned
Almost 70% of handloom households earn less than Rs 5,000 a month (source: financialexpress.com), the major reason for the above-mentioned poor stats is because of the lack of online platforms for them to showcase their work and culture. Our eCommerce design can be the complete solution for bringing on these huge sectors of human resources and their talent to the internet into a global standard and also give them the privilege of respected branding via freelancing modules that are inbuilt.

# What's next for E-commerce for artisans
In the long run, this AI voice model will be able to adapt and respond to multiple languages, providing you with conversational interactions. For the Quality Assurance Check validator all the process will be fully automated with image processing.
